# NeuroMarch

**Gait Pattern Analysis for Diagnosis and Monitoring of Neurological Conditions and Injuries**

Building AI Course Project

## Summary

NeuroMarch is an artificial intelligence project designed to analyze gait patterns and aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of neurological conditions and injuries. Using machine learning techniques, our model can identify specific gait characteristics that correlate with various neurological conditions, providing a valuable tool for healthcare professionals.

## Background

**Problem**

Neurological conditions and injuries can significantly affect people's quality of life. Accurate diagnosis and monitoring are crucial for effective treatment. However, current methods can be subjective and dependent on the clinician's experience.

**Frequency**

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), neurological diseases affect millions of people worldwide. In Spain, for example, it is estimated that more than 4 million people suffer from some neurological disease.

**Importance**

NeuroMarch can help healthcare professionals make more informed decisions, improve the accuracy of diagnosis and monitoring, and ultimately improve patients' quality of life.

## How is it used?

**Context**

NeuroMarch would be used in clinical and rehabilitation settings, such as hospitals and physical therapy clinics.

**Users**

- Healthcare professionals: Physicians, physical therapists, and occupational therapists
- Patients: People with neurological conditions or injuries that affect their gait

**Impact**

NeuroMarch can improve the accuracy of diagnosis and follow-up, reduce variability in clinical assessment, and improve patients' quality of life.

## Data sources and AI methods

**Data Sources**

- Inertial sensor data (accelerometers and gyroscopes)
- Depth camera and RGB data
- Public gait pattern databases

**AI Techniques**
- Deep Learning: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to analyze gait patterns
- Signal Processing: Fourier analysis and wavelets to extract features from inertial sensor data

**Demo**
A simple demo using a public gait pattern database could demonstrate the model's ability to classify normal and abnormal gait patterns.

## 5. Challenges

**Limitations**

- Data Quality: Model accuracy depends on the quality of the training data.
- Gait Variability: Gait can vary significantly between individuals and under different conditions.

**Solutions**

- Data Collection: Collect high-quality and diverse data to train the model.
- Regularization Techniques: Use regularization techniques to manage gait variability.

## What next?

**Improvements**

- Incorporate More Data: Collect more data from different sources and conditions.
- Optimize the Model: Optimize the model to improve its accuracy and efficiency.

**Future Applications**

- Remote Monitoring: Develop an application to remotely monitor patients' gait.
- Integration with Other Systems: Integrate GaitGuard with other healthcare systems to improve coordination and efficiency.
